In the present world that focuses on Technology and computer applications,there is hardly any field that has been untouched by the miracles of technology.The constantly growing field of technology has always excited me and i got interested about exploring the science of computers and information systems.As an enthusiastic gaming fan and technology freak,i always got curious about learning the inner working and algorithms of computer science.As I was passionate about the software working, I started learning programming and coding when I studied computer science as an elective in 11th grade.
